# simpleTodo-app

This Application is designed with Bootstrap 4 classes. This is in line with my current task of learning bootstrap 4.
I picked this framework due to its simplicity. writing less CSS, time saving and Mobile First responsiveness.

In this application you can Add Tasks, Delete and Search for tasks/todo's that are saved in memory.

I have researched a lot to get the logic behind It's functionality which is powered by JAVASCRIPT ES6. I am still learning-
a lot in Front-end Web Development. Each day that passes I get more skills in the bag.
